### PupAlz

## Description
Code to process and analyze data from the PupAlz project. Pupil dilation 
data is collected using a Tobii eyetracker and E-prime. Pupil data was
collected during several tasks, including digit span, verbal fluency, HVLT, 
stroop, and auditory oddball.

## Code
Scripts are organized by task. Each task has a script to process subject data
and a script to analyze group data. Subject scripts should be run first followed
by group scripts. The pupil_utils.py script contains functions used by all scripts.
